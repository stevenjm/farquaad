Farquaad is a FastCGI server that simply returns a 403 error to Tor
users, or a 200 response otherwise. It is intended to be used in
conjunction with nginx's http_auth_request module.

The full documentation is maintained in POD format in the farquaad
script itself. It may be read using perldoc(1), or by opening the
script in a pager such as less(1).
